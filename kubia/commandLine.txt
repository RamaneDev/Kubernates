Extending Kubernetes (last chapter)
Defining custom API objects:
        Throughout the book, you’ve learned about the API objects that Kubernetes provides
    and how they’re used to build application systems. Currently, Kubernetes
    users mostly use only these objects even though they represent relatively low-level,
    generic concepts.

        As the Kubernetes ecosystem evolves, you’ll see more and more high-level objects,
    which will be much more specialized than the resources Kubernetes supports today.
    Instead of dealing with Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and the like, you’ll create
    and manage objects that represent whole applications or software services. A custom
    controller will observe those high-level objects and create low-level objects based on
    them. For example, to run a messaging broker inside a Kubernetes cluster, all you’ll
    need to do is create an instance of a Queue resource and all the necessary Secrets,
    Deployments, and Services will be created by a custom Queue controller. Kubernetes
    already provides ways of adding custom resources like this.
