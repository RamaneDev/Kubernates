curl --cacert /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt https://kubernetes

we can export "--cacert /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt" to ENV 
to make command easier to use and after that we can use only : curl https://kubernetes commandLine

to export into  ENV we can use the following commande :

export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt

after doing that the server will getting Unauthorized response from the K8S Server API rest

in order to get response wi have to bind a token with request : 

first w'll store token in ENV  by this command

TOKEN=$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)

and then, send it in header request like that : 

root@curl:/# curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://kubernetes
