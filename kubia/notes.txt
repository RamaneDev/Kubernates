Adding individual kernel capabilities to a container :

- Instead of making a container privileged and giving it unlimited permissions, a
  much safer method (from a security perspective) is to give it access only to the kernel
  features it really requires.

- Kubernetes allows you to add capabilities to each container
  or drop part of them, which allows you to fine-tune the container’s permissions and
  limit the impact of a potential intrusion by an attacker.

exemple : the pod-with-defaults can't set the hardware Time :
    CMD : kubectl exec -it pod-with-defaults -- date +%T -s "12:00:00"
    RES : date: can't set date: Operation not permitted

- If we want to allow the container to change the system time, 
  we can add a capability called CAP_SYS_TIME to the container’s 
  capabilities list ---> see pod-add-settime-capability.yaml

  now if we try w'll see that pod-add-settime-capability can set sys_time : 
  $ kubectl exec -it pod-add-settime-capability -- date +%T -s "12:00:00"
  RES : 12:00:00
