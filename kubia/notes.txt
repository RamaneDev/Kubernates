To run a pod under a different user ID than the one that’s baked into the container
image, you’ll need to set the pod’s securityContext.runAsUser property. You’ll
make the container run as user 'guest', whose user ID in the alpine container image is
405, as shown in ----->  pod-as-user-guest.yaml file in Git-Repo.

after creating a pod with pod-as-user-guest.yaml and execute the id command inside it 
we'll get : uid=405(guest) gid=100(users)
