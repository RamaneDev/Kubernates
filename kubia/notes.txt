---Configuring the container’s security context :

Configuring the security context allows you to do various things:
- Specify the user (the user’s ID) under which the process in the container will run.
- Prevent the container from running as root (the default user a container runs
  as is usually defined in the container image itself, so you may want to prevent
  containers from running as root).
- Run the container in privileged mode, giving it full access to the node’s kernel.
- Configure fine-grained privileges, by adding or dropping capabilities—in contrast to giving the container all possible permissions by running it in privileged mode.
- Set SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) options to strongly lock down a
  container.
- Prevent the process from writing to the container’s filesystem.
