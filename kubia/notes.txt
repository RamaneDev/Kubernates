Dropping capabilities from a container :
-  For example, the default capabilities given to a
   container include the CAP_CHOWN capability, which allows processes 
   to change the ownership of files in the filesystem.

exemple :
$ kubectl exec pod-with-defaults -- ls -la / | grep tmp
  drwxrwxrwt 1 root root 6 May 25 15:00 tmp   (root is the owner)

$ kubectl exec pod-with-defaults chown guest /tmp
$ kubectl exec pod-with-defaults -- ls -la / | grep tmp
  drwxrwxrwt 2 guest root 6 May 25 15:18 tmp  (guest is the owner)

To prevent the container from doing that, you need to drop the capability by listing it
under the containerâ€™s securityContext.capabilities.drop property, 
see ------>  pod-drop-chown-capability.yaml

test : 
$ kubectl exec pod-drop-chown-capability chown guest /tmp
chown: /tmp: Operation not permitted
command terminated with exit code 1
