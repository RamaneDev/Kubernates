Running pods in privileged mode: 
- This is achieved by setting the privileged property 
  in the containerâ€™s securityContext property to true
  see -------->  pod-privileged.yaml
  if we ran the command below : 
  kubectl exec -it pod-privileged ls /dev
  we'll note the diffrence between a pod-privileged and  pod-with-defaults
